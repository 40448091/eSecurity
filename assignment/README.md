# Implications of Quantum Computing on Bitcoin

Advances in Quantum Computing put the cryptographic primitives that protect the Bitcoin Blockchain at risk.

The aim of this project was to build a Bitcoin-like Blockchain Test Framework into which different Cryptographic Providers could be loaded for evaluation and comparison.

The Blockchain itself is built on and extends the work by Daniel van Flyman:

Two crytographic providers are included:

* Elliptic Curve: 
  Incorporates "C# .NET Port of the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function" by Hans Wolff

  _Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve secp256k1 to protect addresses

* Ring Learning With Errors:
