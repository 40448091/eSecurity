For the following words, estimate how many hex characters will be used for the 256-bit AES encryption:

“fox”: 32 with padding
“foxtrot”: 32 with padding 
“foxtrotanteater”: 32 with padding
“foxtrotanteatercastle” : 32 with padding


With 256-bit AES, for n characters in a string, how would you generalise the calculation of the number of hex characters in the cipher text.

Key_size (bits) = 256
Block_size (bytes) = key_size/8
Chars_per_block = bytes_per_block * 2

Blocks = 1+int(msg_length / bytes_per_block)
Bytes = Blocks * 8
Characters = Bytes * 2

How many Base-64 characters would be used
(remember 6 bits are used to represent a Base-64
character):

Key_size (bits) = 256
Block_size (bytes) = key_size/8
Chars_per_block = bytes_per_block * 2

Blocks = 1+int(msg_length / bytes_per_block)
Bytes = Blocks * 8
Characters = Bytes * 2
